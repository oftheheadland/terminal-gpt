## About The Project

https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt/assets/16740832/9197283c-db6a-4b46-bfea-3eb776dd9093

Sick of having to actually remember shell commands? Tired of tapping the up arrow 47 times trying to find that command you ran late last Monday after way too much coffee? Fear not, because TerminallyGPT is here to rescue you from the endless grind of knowing stuff!

TerminallyGPT is a tool that leverages AI to generate and execute shell commands for you. Simply provide a task, and it queries OpenAI's GPT to generate the correct terminal command based on your operating system. You can review the command before itâ€™s run, ensuring control while saving time. Perfect for automating everyday tasks or handling complex terminal operations without memorizing syntax.
